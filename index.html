    <p>ABOUT ME</p>
    <p>
        My name is michael perez, and i am a student of the UM bootcamp and of the coding major of MDC. 
        As a humble and aspiring coder, I believe that the journey of learning is continuous, and I will always strive to grow and improve in my craft.

        My goal is not just to succeed individually, but to become part of a collaborative foundation, making meaningful impacts in the tech world and 
        contributing to the development of innovative solutions that shape the future</p>
